# Joomla Backup

## Requirements
- htaccess support

## Important
The backups directory is protected by a .htaccess file. Please make sure that your webspace supports htaccess. Otherwise the backups could be downloaded by a stranger. That is unlikely because guessing the filename is nearly impossible and if someone guesses the filename, the backup is still encrypted, but an additional security layer (the htaccess protection) is never wrong.
